Due: September 7, 2025

## Git, GitHub

### Q1 - URL of GitHub Repo
The URL for the GitHub Repo is: https://github.com/LauraRomanGonzalez/CS625-Project-Files/tree/main.  
In this URL one should be able to find at least three different files, two of them were new create files (Test and Project) and an uploaded file (LCRG HW1-report.md).

### Q2 - Pull Command

Pull command gets the files from GitHub and can send it tothe local computer, and viceversa.

### Q3 - Local Commits

If the change is not seen in GitHub there could be potentially one of the three steps that could have been forgotte, either in the add (where the file is staged), in the commit step or in the push. If one is sure of the first two, most likely during the push step it may have not been properly completed.

## Markdown

### Q1 - Bulleted List

-Blue  
-Yellow  
-Red  

*The difference between bullet list in comparison to number list is one contains numbers; meanwhile, bullet will only contain a symbol. Therefore, with the numbered list, there could be a priority but that may not be the case for the bullet list.  

### Q2 - Markdown Paragraph

The next step is for me to add a picture of my dog **Sammy**. He is an *Australian sheperd*. He is 8 years old, and red merle. He travel from Mississipi to ***Virgina*** with me when he was adopted.

I will use an 'git pull' to pull the updated files with Sammy's picture back to my local drive.

### Q3 - Animal Image

# My Dog
