Due: September 7, 2025

## Git, GitHub

### Q1 - URL of GitHub Repo
The URL for the GitHub Repo is: https://github.com/LauraRomanGonzalez/CS625-Project-Files/tree/main.  
In this URL one should be able to find at least three different files, two of them were new create files (Test and Project) and an uploaded file (LCRG HW1-report.md).

### Q2 - Pull Command

Pull command gets the files from GitHub and can send it tothe local computer, and viceversa.

### Q3 - Local Commits

If the change is not seen in GitHub there could be potentially one of the three steps that could have been forgotte, either in the add (where the file is staged), in the commit step or in the push. If one is sure of the first two, most likely during the push step it may have not been properly completed.

## Markdown

### Q1 - Bulleted List

-Blue  
-Yellow  
-Red  

*The difference between bullet list in comparison to number list is one contains numbers; meanwhile, bullet will only contain a symbol. Therefore, with the numbered list, there could be a priority but that may not be the case for the bullet list.  

### Q2 - Markdown Paragraph

The next step is for me to add a picture of my dog **Sammy**. He is an *Australian sheperd*. He is 8 years old, and red merle. He travel from Mississipi to ***Virgina*** with me when he was adopted.

[Aussie Information](https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/australian-shepherd/)

I will use an 'git pull' to pull the updated files with Sammy's picture back to my local drive.

### Q3 - Animal Image
### - Picture of my dog Sammy:  

<img src="Sammy.jpeg" height="250" alt="This is a picture of my dog.">

## Python/Seaborn

### Q1 - First Penguin Image

### Q2 - Second Penguin Image

<img src="BarChart_BodyMass.png" height="450" alt="TThis is a picture of the data from penguin table- Barchart.">

### Q3 - Outer Parenthesis

Missing a parethesis gave a Syntha Error for Incomplete Input. The code cannot fully run. Python uses whitespace. That means that Python expects the whitespace in your code to behave predictably. 

## Observable and Vega-Lite

### Q1 - markCircle to markSquare

When changing from MarkCircle to MarkSquare, the graph changed from dots to square shape within the graph. The color and overall image within the graph all reaming the same, execpt for the shape.

### Q2 - markCircle to markPoint

When changed to markPoint, the shape now changed to circle shape; however, these are now hollow circles.

### Q3 - Swap X and Y Axes on Scatterplot

If I need to change the X and Y Axes, I would modify these part of the code that titles the X and Y axis. For the x-axis I would modify this part, vl.x().fieldQ("Add Description"), and for the y-axis I would modify here, vl.y().fieldQ("Add Description").

### Q4 - Remove fieldN(Origin)

The y-axis, makes a sub-category per the Origin, once I remove the line, the graph did not have to sub-categorize it; thereofre, it would aggregate all.
